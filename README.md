# CMSC388F-Final

There a data structure thingy in DataStructures.hs Please use it so we're all on the same page.

Most of franks code is in the frank_working branch, please don't mess with it. Make your own branch. 
Also try not to destroy master by accident.

And always remember, do-while loops are evil.
