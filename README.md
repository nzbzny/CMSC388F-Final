# CMSC388F-Final

Scripts:
build.sh      --    Builds executable called final from Main.hs
clean.sh      --    Cleans the directory of .o and .hi files as well as the final executable

There a data structure thingy in DataStructures.hs Please use it so we're all on the same page.

Most of franks code is in the frank_working branch, please don't mess with it. Make your own branch. 
Also try not to destroy master by accident.

And always remember, do-while loops are evil.
